Create an html document, that passes W3C validation, and which uses flexbox to display a list of items within a content card as per the design supplied. 
Fonts, colours, spacing should match as closely as possible to the design. Use your eye to judge, we will be looking for balance and precision.
You should use straight css and javascript (no jquery) and this should be organised as per the project structure.
